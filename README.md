## "Lineare Algebra ist Kulturgut." - Robert Weismantel

Everything based on main.tex file, where with \input command there are added external latex files, which are separated by topics (like 1.1-vectors.tex, 2.1-matrices.text, and so on).

For colour coding and separation on lemmas, theorems and definitions there are defined custom LaTeX commands as \tsDef, \tsLem, \tsThe, etc.
